# M101JS Homework 2-3

To test this application, first you need to have `mongod` running in your command line.

For this homework you need to make sure that you have imported the data for the `weather` database. 

If you haven't, follow [this link for homework 2-1](https://github.com/onekanaka/M101JS/tree/master/hw2-1) where the process is explained.

Open a new command line window, and install the node modules if don't have them already:

```
npm install
```

Then run:

```
node app.js
```

The application will have the corrections needed for this homework, i.e. be able to create a new user and logging in.
